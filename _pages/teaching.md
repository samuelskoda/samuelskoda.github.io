I have served as a teaching assistant at the University of Zurich for the Econometrics for Policy Analysts course with a seminar (MA level) taught by David Yanagizawa-Drott in Spring 2019 and Spring 2020. See <a href="/assets/pdf/teaching_evals.pdf"> here </a> a sample of the teaching evaluations.

I have been also a teaching assistant for the Labor Economics course (MA level) taught by David Dorn in Fall 2019 and Fall 2020.

Before my doctoral studies I have taught a short introductory econometrics course aimed at high school students with an interest in economics.
