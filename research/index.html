At the time of the reform, only one fifth of job ads contained pay information, strongly varying across firms and occupations. Linking online job board data to administrative social security data, I find that wages of newly hired workers increased, by about 3%, particularly within complying firms that were induced by the reform to show pay information. Job ads posted by these firms received more clicks and applications from job-seekers but I do not find evidence that the wage increase was driven by a positive selection of employees: previous wages of newly hired workers at their prior job did not increase, and additionally, applicants had on average lower pay expectations and characteristics less fitting job ads requirements. Furthermore, I do not find evidence of closing the gender pay gap. Adapting a simple model of partial job search, I illustrate how to interpret these responses.</p> </div> <em> <div class="notes"></div> </em> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="seibel2021collusion" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Collusion by exclusion in public procurement</div> <div class="author"> with Regina Seibel </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Submitted, </em> 2023 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/collusion.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper studies bid rigging in auctions with bidder preselection. We develop a theoretical model to analyze the optimal behavior of a bid-rigging cartel and show how two-stage auction formats, in which the first stage is used to preselect bidders, may be exploited. Bidder preselection based on opening bids allows cartels to exclude rivals and thereby increase procurement costs. To test our predictions, we use administrative data from public procurement in Slovakia. By leveraging a unique auction format reform we show that after a preselection procedure was abandoned, the savings gap between potentially rigged and non-rigged auctions decreased by 48%. In contrast to the conventional motivation for two-stage auctions, our analysis suggests that two-stage auctions might facilitate bid rigging and increase procurement costs.</p> </div> <em> <div class="notes"></div> </em> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <h4 id="in-progress">In progress</h4> <div class="publications"> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="skoda2021insuring" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Insuring the self-employed: Evidence on asymmetric information in UI</div> <div class="author"> </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This project studies selection of self-employed into a voluntary unemployment insurance scheme using administrative data from Slovakia. Contrary to conventional rationale for mandating unemployment insurance I find evidence of advantageous rather than adverse selection into the UI scheme. However, focusing on a reform that reset existing contracts and effectively shrank the pool of insured, I find evidence of adverse selection within the pool of initially insured. These findings are consistent with existence of a non-monotonic marginal cost curve.</p> </div> <em> <div class="notes"></div> </em> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="skoda2021fiscal" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Fiscal multipliers in the European Union: Evidence from the use of European structural and investment funds in Slovakia</div> <div class="author"> </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> <em> <div class="notes"></div> </em> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <h4 id="journal-articles">Journal articles</h4> <div class="publications"> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="levinsky2021doelections" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Do elections accelerate the COVID-19 pandemic?

In this paper, we examine whether large-scale, in-person elections propagate the spread of COVID-19. We exploit a natural experiment from the Czech Republic which biannually renews man- dates in 1/3 of Senate constituencies rotating according to the 1995 election law. We show that in the second and third weeks after the 2020 elections (held on October 9-10), new COVID-19 infections grow significantly faster in voting compared to non-voting constituencies. A temporarily-related peak in hospital admissions and essentially no changes in test positivity rates suggest that the acceleration is not merely due to increased testing. The acceleration is absent in population above 65, consistently with strategic risk-avoidance by older voters. Our results have implications for postal voting reforms or postponing of large-scale, in-person (electoral) events during viral outbreaks.</p> </div> <em> <div class="notes"></div> </em> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="lichard2021scientific" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Do women face a glass ceiling at home?

From analysis of the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, we first show that married or cohabiting women do twice as much household work as single women with the same income. Furthermore, women’s time spent in home production does not vary in relation to the couple’s relative wages in Southern Europe. We find a positive elasticity of substitution between male and female labor in home production with respect to their relative within-couple wages in Western Europe. Our identification is based on predicting each country’s wage distributions within gender-specific cells defined by age group and education using distributions in all the other countries. We present a positive evidence for presence of a “second-shift” that women face especially in Southern Europe, which may stem from regional gender norms.</p> </div> <em> <div class="notes"></div> </em> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="jurajda2017scientific" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Scientific publication performance in post-communist countries: still lagging far behind</div> <div class="author"> with Štěpán Jurajda, Stanislav Kozubek and Daniel Münich </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Scientometrics, </em> 2017, 112(1): 315–328 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2389-8" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">DOI</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/publication_performance.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We present a bibliometric comparison of publication performance in 226 scientific disciplines in the Web of Science (WoS) for six post-communist EU member states relative to six EU-15 countries of a comparable size. We compare not only overall country-level publication counts, but also high quality publication output where publication quality is inferred from the journal Article Influence Scores. As of 2010–2014, post-communist countries are still lagging far behind their EU counterparts, with the exception of a few scientific disciplines mainly in Slovenia. Moreover, research in post-communist countries tends to focus relatively more on quantity rather than quality. The relative publication performance of post-communist countries in the WoS is strongest in natural sciences and engineering. Future research is needed to reveal the underlying causes of these performance differences, which may include funding and productivity gaps, the historical legacy of the communist ideology, and Web of Science coverage differences.</p> </div> <em> <div class="notes"></div> </em> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2930004b8d7fcd0a8e00fdcfc8fc9f24"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?da39b660470d1ba6e6b8bf5f37070b6e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> </header> </body> </html>
